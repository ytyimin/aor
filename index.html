					<p class="editable">This is an excellent, interesting read. It’s a great idea on two levels: First, It helps the reader to quickly find and better understand relevant, cutting edge operations research articles, and second, the author interviews at the end are invaluable, allowing authors the rare opportunity to elaborate on what they have published, and help the reader to better understand what they have written. A great idea, flawlessly executed, and an excellent read. Bravo to the ASU Operations Management Review team!</p>
