			<p>Since the genesis of operations management (OM), scholars have addressed managerial topics, emphasizing the relevance of their studies. Such effort has positioned operations management as an academic field renowned for its connection to practice. Given the research direction, the academic community has flourished in terms of the number of scholars, the volume of research outputs, and the diversity of research themes. </p>
			<p>While we appreciate advances in OM by previous contributors, we face another challenge today. The continuous development in OM has led to a flood of new knowledge, which cannot be easily handled by a single research entity. In addition, the field has also deepened the depth of new knowledge, making it much more time-consuming to internalize the new knowledge than previously. Furthermore, real-world problems are becoming more complex and emerging more rapidly. These new challenges increase the friction between stakeholders in the field of operations management. Indeed, as we study OM and other relevant subjects, we consistently witness that stakeholders suffer from the burden of learning new knowledge. Despite the arduous learning process while floundering in the flood of cutting-edge knowledge from recent advances in academia, many graduate students often forget the details of the knowledge as they move onto the next stage of their academic careers. Likewise, although professors are the main entity of pioneering knowledge, many of them are repeatedly chased by their hectic schedules and thus suffer from insufficient time to digest new knowledge. Meanwhile, practitioners frequently feel distant from academic advances because of the entry barrier intensified by far-reaching scientific advances. Looking back at how OM took place and how it contributes to the real world, one might question as to what the OM community should do to address this burden of new knowledge. </p>
			<p>The vision of ASU OM Review (AOR) is to channel new knowledge learned by PhD students to stakeholders of OM. AOR helps its editors understand OM more comprehensively as they evaluate research, address relevant issues, and link new knowledge to real-world issues. Extensive and constructive reviews of AOR also assist peer researchers in navigating their research directions through the fresh eyes of AOR editors, especially in new research domains. Finally, reader-friendly and concise content of AOR eases the understanding of academic knowledge for practitioners, thus bridging the gap between practitioners and academic scholars. </p>
